# SvelteKit Skeleton

Just a super simple SvelteKit starter with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Prettier and ESLint setup, using tilt and pnpm.

Setup with `@sveltejs/adapter-auto` to enable easy deploys to Cloudflare Pages, Netlify and Vercel.

## Using this skeleton

Run `npx degit "git@github.com:kyleshepherd/svelte-kit-skeleton.git" my-app` to clone the starter.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```bash
tilt up && tilt down
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
